# Run Your WebApp

This short walkthrough is for learning how to run your web app.

## Express.js

In order to host our web app, we have set up the initial routing for the website using Express.js - a Node.js webapp framework.

First, please install Node.js and npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ if you have not previously used Node.js. 

To ensure everything works as intended, please uninstall and install express on your local computer using these commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm uninstall express
```

```bash
npm install express --save
```

If you run into an error, be sure you are in the correct folder (should be your repository's main folder) and that you have installed Node.js

Once you do this, run `npm start` and visit localhost:8000 in your browser. 

## Color Palette

Now it's time to choose a color palette for your website! 

Please choose a palette from this website or any other palette website you like to use :)

[Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/)

You should primarily use these colors for the main components of your web application so be sure to bookmark the palette you choose!

## You're Set!

Perfect, now you're ready to get into building the webapp! 

Please ask for help if you are running into issues before moving forward. Otherwise, head over to the next walkthrough!
